                       <h2> 1. Bench Press</h2> <br>
                        What else would be #1?
                        
                        <p>It might have a bad reputation thanks to ego-lifters putting too much weight on the bar or people focusing exclusively <br>
                        on this lift, but that doesn't change the fact that it's arguably the single best upper-body compound movement. <br>
                        It recruits major muscles like the pecs and the shoulders, while also taxing your triceps and lats, and because you <br>
                         can load the most weight onto the bar using the bench press, you'll find this one promotes chest growth better than <br>
                         any other exercise.</p>

                         <br> <h2>2. Cable Fly</h2><br><br>
                        <p>Fun fact about the chest: it doesn't just activate when you push a weight away from you, but when you bring your arms
                        across your body. Therefore, to properly train your chest muscles, you need to work them through their full range
                        of motion. The cable fly is our choice, as opposed to its banded and dumbbell variants, because you can increase 
                        the tension easily and keep that tension consistent through the full range of the movement. </p>

                        <br><h2>3. Pushups and Pushup Variants</h2> <br><br>
                        <p>Pushups are about as old school an exercise as exists, and that kind of longevity isn't an <br>
                         accident. They mimic the bench press in their ability to recruit muscle groups, from your <br>
                         chest to your shoulders, triceps, and even core, but because you don't have the bench to <br>
                         stabilize your shoulder girdle, you'll be training this more as well, giving pushups the <br>
                         added benefit of improving shoulder health and mobility.Once you master the basic <br>
                         pushup, you can start attempting variants to add difficulty: these include <br>
                         close-grip/diamond pushups, staggered pushups (where your hands are unevenly spaced), <br>
                         and weighted or elevated pushups. The possibilities are endless.</p>
